# DeSpaM
DeSpaM: Decomposed Spatial Modulator for efficient facial expression recognition (FER).

DeSpaM is a lightweight decomposed spatial modulator that generates a single-channel spatial gating map on the full $H \times W$ grid (without global pooling) to improve the accuracy-latency tradeoff in real-time facial expression recognition.
